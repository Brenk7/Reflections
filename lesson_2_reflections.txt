Q: What happens when you initialize a git repository? Why do you need to do it?

  A: Init will create a blank repository that you can then add your files to. It is similar to creating any other initial file
  structure.

Q: How is the working directory different from the staging area and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    A: The working directory shows all the files that are located in the respective directory. All of the files don't necessarily have to
    be associated with the repository or git at all. The staging area is an intermediate step that allows you to review what you are adding
    prior to making a commit to the repository.
